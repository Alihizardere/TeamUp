## Architecture


### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

The MVVM architecture is chosen for these key reasons:

- **Separation of Concerns:**
MVVM divides the application into three distinct components: Model, View, and ViewModel. This separation ensures that each part of the application has a clear and specific role, making the codebase more modular, easier to maintain, and testable.

- **Data Binding:**
MVVM allows for two-way data binding between the View and ViewModel. This means that when the data in the ViewModel changes, the View automatically reflects these changes and vice versa. This leads to a more responsive user interface and reduces the need for boilerplate code.

- **Testability:**
By isolating the business logic within the ViewModel, MVVM makes the application more testable. The ViewModel can be tested independently of the View, ensuring that the business logic is correct without the need to involve the UI.

#### MVVM Components:

- **Model:** Encapsulates the data and business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the data and providing it to the ViewModel.

- **View:** Displays the data and responds to user interactions. The View observes the ViewModel for updates and reflects any changes in the UI.

- **ViewModel:** Acts as an intermediary between the View and Model. It retrieves data from the Model and transforms it for display in the View. It also handles the user input logic and updates the Model accordingly.

Using MVVM promotes a clean, organized, and maintainable code structure, ensuring a robust and scalable application.
